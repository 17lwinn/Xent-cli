# command line flags

Xent comes with a selection of command line flags. You execute them with the start command-

```python
python3 main.py <flags>
```

`-h` - view help text
`--version` - view CLI version
`-r <scriptname/path>` - run a ,xt file through the lexer

if you want to enter the interpreter, just run 
```python
python3 main.py
```

# interpreter commands

Type any Xent code into the interpreter and it will save to a file, this file is deleted later on.

1. `run()` - run any code you typed in earlier
2. `forcerun()`- run any code WITHOUT UNLINKING THE FILE
3. `exit()` - exit the interpreter
4. `moomoo()` - :D we brought a cow!
